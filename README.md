Rails is a web framework that uses ruby as a programming language, this framework is based on MVC pattern to create dynamic web applications in an easy way.

Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility.

Rails uses Active Record as a primary class to handle the communication between database and model, taking into account MVC pattern. Active Record represent each row into database as an object.
